= About EJB Method Permissions

EJBs can restrict access to their methods to specific security roles.

The EJB `<method-permission>` element declaration specifies the roles that
can invoke the interface methods of the EJB. You can specify permissions for
the following combinations:

* All home and component interface methods of the named EJB
* A specified method of the home or component interface of the named EJB
* A specified method within a set of methods with an overloaded name
