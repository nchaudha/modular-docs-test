* A server and server runtime for {ProductShortName} have been set up.
//See link:{LinkDevelopmentGuide}#add_the_jboss_eap_server_to_red_hat_jboss_developer_studio[Add the {ProductShortName} Server to JBoss Developer Studio] in the link:{LinkDevelopmentGuide}[Development Guide].

. Enter the following details:
+
** *Project name:* The name of the project that appears in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, and also the default file name for the deployed EAR file.
** *Project location:* The directory where the project files will be saved. The default is a directory in the current workspace.
** *Target runtime:* This is the server runtime used for the project. This will need to be set to the same {ProductShortName} runtime used by the server that you will be deploying to.
** *EAR version:* This is the version of the Java Enterprise Edition specification that your project will comply with. Red Hat recommends using Java EE 7.
** *Configuration:* This allows you to adjust the supported features in your project. Use the default configuration for your selected runtime.
+
Click *Next* to continue.

. Add a new EJB module.
+
New modules can be added from the *Enterprise Application* page of the wizard. To add a new EJB Project as a module follow the steps below:

.. Click *New Module*, uncheck *Create Default Modules* checkbox, select the *Enterprise Java Bean* and click *Next*. The *New EJB Project wizard* appears.
.. The *New EJB Project wizard* is the same as the wizard used to create new standalone EJB Projects and is described in xref:create_an_ejb_archive_project_using_red_hat_jboss_developer_studio[Create an EJB Archive Project Using Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio].
+
The minimum details required to create the project are:
+
** Project name
** Target runtime
** EJB module version
** Configuration
+
All the other steps of the wizard are optional. Click *Finish* to complete creating the EJB Project.
+
The newly created EJB project is listed in the Java EE module
dependencies and the checkbox is checked.

. Optionally, add an `application.xml` deployment descriptor.
+
Check the *Generate application.xml deployment descriptor* checkbox if one is required.

. Click *Finish*.
+
Two new projects will appear: the EJB project and the EAR project.

. Add the build artifact to the server for deployment.
+
Open the *Add and Remove* dialog by right-clicking in the *Servers* tab on the server you want to deploy the built artifact to in the server tab and then select *Add and Remove*.
+
Select the EAR resource to deploy from the *Available* column and click the *Add* button. The resource will be moved to the Configured column. Click *Finish* to close the dialog.

You now have an Enterprise Application Project with a member EJB
Project. This will build and deploy to the specified server as a single EAR deployment containing an EJB subdeployment.
