= EJB Client Code Simplification

You can simplify the EJB client code when invoking the EJB server-side clustered components. The following procedures outline the multiple ways to simplify the EJB client code:

* xref:initial_context_lookup[Initial Context Lookup]
* xref:remote_ejb_configuration_file[Remote EJB Configuration File]
* xref:automatic_transaction_stickiness_for_ejbs[Automatic Transaction Stickiness for EJBs]
* xref:ejb_transactions_in_a_clustered_environment[EJB Transactions in a Clustered Environment]

NOTE: The use of the `jboss-ejb-client.properties` file is deprecated in favor of the `wildfly-config.xml` file.
