= About EJB Security Identity

An EJB can specify an identity to use when invoking methods on other components. This is the EJB security identity, also known as invocation identity.

By default, the EJB uses its own caller identity. The identity can alternatively be set to a specific security role. Using specific security roles is useful when you want to construct a segmented security model, for example, restricting access to a set of components to internal EJBs only.
