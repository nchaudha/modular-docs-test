// This assembly is included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// For more details on writing an assembly, see section "Forming Assemblies" in the Modular Documentation Reference Guide.

// Include an 'ID' that corresponds to the title of the assembly.
// The ID will be used as an anchor for linking to the title.
// Do not change the ID to make sure existing links keep working.
// If the assembly is reused in other assemblies in a guide, include {context} in the ID: [id='a-collection-of-modules-{context}'].
[id='a-collection-of-modules']
= A collection of modules
:context: collection-modules
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.

_If the assembly covers a task, start the title with a verb in the gerund form, such as Creating or Configuring._

// Ideally, base the name of the file on the title to avoid confusion.
// Use a consistent system for file names and IDs. For recommendations, see section "Anchor Names and File Names" in the Modular Documentation Reference Guide.

This paragraph explains what the user will accomplish by working through the modules in the assembly and sets the context for the user story the assembly is based on. Can include more than one paragraph. Consider using the information from the user story.

[id='prerequisites-{context}']
== Prerequisites

* A bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts following this assembly.

* You can also link to other modules or assemblies the user must follow before starting this assembly.

* Delete the section title and bullets if the assembly has no prerequisites.

_The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other assemblies._

include::modules/path-to-a-module-file.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// [leveloffset=+1] ensures that when a module starts with a level-1 heading (= Heading), the heading will be interpreted as a level-2 heading (== Heading) in the assembly.

include::modules/path-to-another-module-file.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::path-to-an-assembly-file.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[id='additional-resources-{context}']
== Additional Resources

* A bulleted list of links to concept, reference, or procedures modules and assemblies closely related to the user story in this assembly.

* Include only the most relevant resources, not every possible related resources.

* Delete the section title and bullets if no related information is needed.
