. Enter the following details:

** *Project name:* The name of the project that appears in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, and also the default file name for the deployed JAR file.
** *Project location:* The directory where the project files will be saved. The default is a directory in the current workspace.
** *Target runtime:* This is the server runtime used for the project. This will need to be set to the same *{ProductShortName}* runtime used by the server that you will be deploying to.
** *EJB module version:* This is the version of the EJB specification that your enterprise beans will comply with. Red Hat recommends using *3.2*.
** *Configuration:* This allows you to adjust the supported features in your project. Use the default configuration for your selected runtime.
+
Click *Next* to continue.

. The *Java* project configuration screen allows you to add directories containing Java source files and specify the directory for the output of the build.
+
Leave this configuration unchanged and click *Next*.

. In the *EJB Module* settings screen, check *Generate ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor* if a deployment descriptor is required. The deployment descriptor is optional in EJB 3.2 and can be added later if required.
+
Click *Finish* and the project is created and will be displayed in the Project Explorer.

. To add the project to the server for deployment, right-click on the target server in the *Server* tab and choose *Add and Remove*.
+
In the *Add and Remove* dialog, select the resource to deploy from the *Available* column and click the *Add* button. The resource will be moved to the *Configured* column. Click *Finish* to close the dialog.

You now have an EJB project in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio that can build and deploy to the specified server.

[WARNING]
====
If no enterprise beans are added to the project then Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio will display the warning stating *_An EJB module must contain one or more enterprise beans._* This warning will disappear once one or more enterprise beans have been added to the project.
