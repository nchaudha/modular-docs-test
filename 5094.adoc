= Create a JMS-based Message-Driven Bean in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

This procedure shows how to add a JMS-based message-driven bean to a project in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio. This procedure creates an EJB 3.x message-driven bean that uses annotations.

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

* You must have an existing project open in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio.
* You must know the name and type of the JMS destination that the bean will be listening to.
* Support for Java Messaging Service (JMS) must be enabled in the
{ProductShortName} configuration to which this bean will be deployed.

== Add a JMS-based Message-driven Bean in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

. Open the *Create EJB 3.x Message-Driven Bean* wizard.
+
Go to *File -> New -> Other*. Select *EJB/Message-Driven Bean (EJB 3.x)* and click the *Next* button.

. Specify class file destination details.
+
There are three sets of details to specify for the bean class here: project, Java class, and message destination.
+
** *Project:*
*** If multiple projects exist in the workspace, ensure that the correct one is selected in the *Project* menu.
*** The folder where the source file for the new bean will be created is `ejbModule` under the selected project's directory. Only change this if you have a specific requirement.
** *Java Class:*
*** The required fields are: *Java package* and *Class name*.
*** It is not necessary to supply a superclass unless the business logic of your application requires it.
** *Message Destination:*
*** These are the details you must supply for a JMS-based message-driven bean:
**** *Destination name*, which is the queue or topic name that contains the messages that the bean will respond to.
**** By default the *JMS* checkbox is selected. Do not change this.
**** Set *Destination type* to *Queue* or *Topic* as required.
+
Click the *Next* button.

. Enter message-driven bean specific information.
+
The default values here are suitable for a JMS-based message-driven bean
using container-managed transactions.
+
** Change the *Transaction type* to Bean if the Bean will use Bean-managed transactions.
** Change the *Bean name* if a different bean name than the class name is required.
** The *JMS Message Listener* interface will already be listed. You do not need to add or remove any interfaces unless they are specific to your
application's business logic.
** Leave the checkboxes for creating method stubs selected.
+
Click the *Finish* button.

.Result
The message-driven bean is created with stub methods for the
default constructor and the `onMessage()` method. A Red Hat JBoss
Developer Studio editor window opens with the corresponding file.
