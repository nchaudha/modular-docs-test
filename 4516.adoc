= About Resource Adapters

A resource adapter is a deployable Java EE component that provides communication between a Java EE application and an Enterprise Information System (EIS) using the Java Connector Architecture (JCA) specification. A resource adapter is often provided by EIS vendors to allow easy integration of their products with Java EE applications.

An Enterprise Information System can be any other software system within an organization. Examples include Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, database systems, e-mail servers and proprietary messaging systems.

A resource adapter is packaged in a Resource Adapter Archive (RAR) file which can be deployed to {ProductShortName}. A RAR file may also be included in an Enterprise Archive (EAR) deployment.

The resource adapter itself is defined within the `resource-adapters` subsystem, which is provided by the IronJacamar project.
