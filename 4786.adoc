= About Remote EJB Access Using SSL Encryption

By default, the network traffic for Remote Method Invocation (RMI) of
EJB2 and EJB3 Beans is not encrypted. In instances where encryption is
required, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) can be utilized so that the
connection between the client and server is encrypted. Using SSL also
has the added benefit of allowing the network traffic to traverse some
firewalls, depending on the firewall configuration.
