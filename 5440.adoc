== Add Session Beans to a Project in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

. Open the project in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio.

+
To open the *Create EJB 3.x Session Bean wizard*, navigate to the *File* menu, select *New* and then select *Session Bean (EJB 3.x)*.

. Specify following details:
+
** *Project:* Verify the correct project is selected.
** *Source folder:* This is the folder that the Java source files will be created in. This should not usually need to be changed.
** *Package:* Specify the package that the class belongs to.
** *Class name:* Specify the name of the class that will be the session bean.
** *Superclass:* The session bean class can inherit from a superclass. Specify that here if your session has a superclass.
** *State type:* Specify the state type of the session bean: stateless, stateful or singleton.
** *Business interfaces:* By default the *No-interface* box is checked so no interfaces will be created. Check the boxes for the interfaces you wish to define and adjust the names if necessary.
+
Remember that enterprise beans in a web archive (WAR) only support EJB 3.2 Lite and this does not include remote business interfaces.
+
Click *Next*.

. You can enter in additional information here to further customize the session bean. It is not required to change any of the information here.
+
Items that you can change are:
+
** Bean name
** Mapped name
** Transaction type (container managed or bean managed)
** Additional interfaces can be supplied that the bean must implement
** You can also specify EJB 2.x Home and Component interfaces if
required

. Click *Finish* and the new session bean will be created and added to the project. The files for any new business interfaces will also be created if they were specified.
